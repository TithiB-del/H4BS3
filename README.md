This is a one person player game designed to elaborate on the journey of the hackathon in the eyes of the the hacker. the game starts off with some challenges, which need to be overcome once the hacking starts. there are a few collectibles on tthe way, that is:

  Heart- This represents the love that is generally shown for an impressive project, & for exceptional valor shown in the course of the hackathon.<br>
  sometimes, a little support can work wonders, who knows?

  Burger- Represents all the tasty meals that the hackers had access to at the venue. More the food, more the merrier!

<p>
 Currently, There are no point based system as I dont wanna make it competitive, it is what I created just for fun & also as an opportunity to parse a new domain. Also, this was an idea which I decided randomly at 6am on the 2nd day of the hackathon, thus giving me much less time to work on but i enjoyed the wholwe process.
Wanted to include a progress bar but that would again increase competitiveness, as somewhone who beta tested this game, wanted me to make cheat codes & hacks for the games they play xD (haan thoda personal ho gaya lekin okay)
</p>
<p>
 This game was based on my experience at Hack4Bengal 3.0, but in some way, applies to all the hackathons in some way. If possible I might include future versions with better game dynamics & maybe, maybe add a personal touch to it. This serves as a testament to what I did, my journey in this particular hackathon, & go try out the game about which you read till this part.
